# APIHimotoKit [![Swift Package Manager](https://img.shields.io/badge/Swift%20Package%20Manager-compatible-brightgreen.svg)](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager)

__APIHimotoKit__ is an ___unofficial___ tool for trials of the [Swift Package Manager](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/blob/master/README.md).

Currently, it JUST downloads the source code of the [APIKit](https://github.com/ishkawa/APIKit) and the [Himotoki](https://github.com/ikesyo/Himotoki) from GitHub.

The goal is making full use of the Swift Package Manager.üí•

## Note

- ‚ö†Ô∏è __APIHimotoKit__ is an ___unofficial___ tool. 
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Please note, the Swift Package Manager is still in early design and development.

## Requirements for Tools

- OS X 10.11 (El Capitan)

## Getting Started

1. The first step to using __APIHimotoKit__ is to download and install the Swift Development Snapshots. Go to the [Download](https://swift.org/download/#snapshots) page and follow the instructions on OS X.

2. You can make the tools available for use from the terminal with the following command:
  
  ```bash
  $ export PATH=/Library/Developer/Toolchains/swift-latest.xctoolchain/usr/bin:"${PATH}"
  ```
  If the following error has occurred,

  ```bash
  dyld: Library not loaded: @rpath/libswiftCore.dylib
  ```
  
  You might be able to fix that from the terminal with the following command:
  
  - https://gist.github.com/norio-nomura/96201467ffd37c077f7c
  
3. Please download from the latest [release](https://github.com/JPMartha/APIHimotoKit/releases) and deploy the `Package.swift` and the `Makefile` at the root directory of your project. 

4. Run the following command:

  ```bash
  $ make
  ```
  
  Then, you can see the downloaded sources in the `Packages/` directory at the root of your project.
